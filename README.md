     ========================================================================================= -->

## Overview
Machine Learning (ELEC 8900) is a specialized graduate course in the Master of Engineering (MEng) program at the University of Windsor. This course introduces machine learning, covering fundamental concepts, techniques, and algorithms. It explores supervised learning methods including linear regression, logistic regression, multiclass classification, neural networks (CNN, RNN, FNN, deep learning), and decision trees (bias-variance decomposition). The unsupervised learning section covers probabilistic models, principle component analysis, K-Means, EM algorithm, and provides an overview of reinforcement learning.

### Course Objectives
The curriculum encompasses several key machine learning domains:
- **Supervised Learning**: Mastering regression and classification techniques to predict continuous variables and categorize data.
- **Neural Networks**: Designing and training deep learning models, including CNNs and RNNs, for complex pattern recognition.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Implementing clustering algorithms (K-Means, EM) and dimensionality reduction (PCA) for data analysis.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Understanding the foundations of agent-based learning, Markov decision processes, and exploration-exploitation trade-offs.
- **Applied Engineering**: Applying theoretical concepts to real-world datasets through rigorous programming projects.

### Repository Purpose
This repository represents a curated collection of study materials, reference books, supplemental resources, assignment reports, course projects, and technical presentations. The primary motivation for creating and maintaining this archive is simple yet profound: **to preserve knowledge for continuous learning and future reference**.

As the field of Artificial Intelligence evolves, the fundamental principles remain the bedrock of modern engineering. This repository serves as my intellectual reference point: a resource I can return to for reviewing algorithms, refreshing theoretical concepts, and strengthening technical understanding.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to comprehensive study materials beyond the classroom
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of fundamental Machine Learning principles
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my learning journey through Machine Learning
- **Community Contribution**: To share these resources with students and learners who may benefit from them

> [!NOTE]
> All materials were created, compiled, and organized by me during the Fall 2023 semester as part of my MEng degree requirements.
